    <p2>In this project, Aonee and Hoda explore the balance between screen time and outdoor activity through a minimalist HTML website. By archiving data collected from screen time and health trackers, including daily step counts and top app usage, we offer a raw and transparent view of our digital habits. This project highlights the concept of sousveillance—self-surveillance—inviting viewers to reflect on the subtle ways technology influences their behavior and productivity. The simple HTML presentation and ASCII art of footprints challenge conventional data representation, fostering a broader discussion on the cultural impact of technology.
