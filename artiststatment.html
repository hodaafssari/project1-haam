    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p> In this project, Aonee and Hoda embarked on a data research initiative to explore the balance between screen time and outdoor activity. We created a website using only HTML to visually archive and present the data gathered over three days, documenting both screen time and physical steps taken. This approach not only highlights the raw data but also serves as a critique of modern technology’s impact on our daily lives.
        <br>

        The primary objective of our project was to construct a straightforward yet insightful website that contrasts the time spent on our phones with time dedicated to outdoor activities. Through the use of Screen Time in Settings and Health tracker, we collected data on our daily screen time and step counts, including a detailed record of our top three most-used apps. This data is presented in a minimalist HTML format to emphasize its rawness and transparency.

        Our project delves into the concept of sousveillance—self-surveillance—by meticulously tracking personal screen time and physical activity. This approach invites viewers to reflect on their own technology use and its potential impact on their productivity and physical health. By presenting this data in a simple HTML layout, we underscore the transparent nature of self-surveillance, challenging viewers to consider how technology subtly influences their behavior and decision The contrast between our screen time and physical activity data prompts a broader discussion about the effects of technology on our daily lives and productivity. Through a simple HTML presentation and the use of ASCII art to represent physical footprints, we challenge conventional methods of data representation and encourage viewers to reflect on the cultural implications of their technology use.
