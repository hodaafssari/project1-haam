    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p> Behind hide this first project idea, we had to make a simple website using only HTML.
      For the website what we decided to do was to make a simple constructive wesbite of how much time we spend on our phones
      in comparison to how much we spend outside, doing outside activity. In the website both Aonee and Hoda had a Screen time and Health tracker
      that was gathering data from how many steps we were taking for three days, and how much screen time we had for 3 days. The screen time
      tracker also kept track of our top three apps that we spent the most time on. The point of this project was to do a survellenice archive of how 
      constantly being on your phone for long periods of long periods of time can so long you lose the movitivation to actually go out, work on finsihing important task, or even
      staying in doors all day with 0 productivity.
